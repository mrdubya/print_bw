Black & White Color Scheme
==========================

This color scheme is just black and white but uses the font attributes bold,
italic, and underline.  This allows printing of highlighted files on black and
white printers where shades of gray can be hard to read.  On color printers it
also means you don't use up the more expensive colored inks. 

The color scheme is meant to be used just when printing.  Change colorscheme to
print_bw, print, and then change back to your prefered scheme.  This could be
done via a map or a script.
 
Installation
============

The recommended approach is use
[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and to clone this plugin into
your bundle directory.
